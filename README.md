### Hints
As i want this to be avaible for everyone, i could not figure out a way to turn this program into a stable application. So in order to use this, you need to run the source code

## Quick Tutorial
###### This is just a quick walkthrough, more detailed explanations below

1. Download the file "script.py" from this repository
2. Download and install Python
3. Download and install a Programming Development Environment (like Visual Studio Code)
4. Open the Program from step 3, create a project (folder) and add the "script.py" file to it
5. Get Python to run in your project -> for Visual Studio Code: Navigate to Extensions on the left sidebar, search for "Python" and install it (you should get 3 Python Related Extensions). Then, you need a Virtual Environment. Press "Shift + Ctrl + P", search "Python: Create Environment" and select it, select "venv", select Python. In case of errors, restart Visual Studio Code and repeat until it works
6. Open a Terminal (top bar) and install all required Packages (*opencv-python* | *numpy* | *easyocr* | *pyqt6*). To do so, Run "pip install *package-name*" inside your Terminal
7. Now run the Program (in VSC: either press the ▶︎ Button or type "python script.py" in the Terminal)
8. That's it! 2 Windows should open and you are free to explore what the program has to offer. More details about the controls and OBS will be at the end of the detailed explanation
